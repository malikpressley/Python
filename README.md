# Python
This is a demonstration of my best practices applied - using the sample project "instacart".

### **Objective**

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more infromation about their sales patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze customer behavior and uncover patterns for growth.

### Data

The data set that compromises of information on:

-   orders
-   products 
-   departments

### Tools

For this project, the following python libraries were used:

-   pandas - for data analysis
-   seaborn - for data visualization

### Executing the code

The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/

To launch the notebook, open the terminal and run the command:

-   importing data: jupyter notebook importData.ipynb

-generate CrossTabs: jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb
